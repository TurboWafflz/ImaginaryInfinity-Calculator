ImaginaryInfinity Calculator v2.1
Copyright 2020 Finian Wright

ImaginaryInfinity Calculator is a lightweight, but expandable calculator. It's
command line interface is designed to resemble that of some graphing
calculators.

Plugins:
New functionality can easily be added by placing Python files with additional
functions in the plugins directory. To access a function added by a plugin,
type "[plugin].[function]()". For example, if you wanted to run the function
"egg" from the plugin "food", you would type "food.egg()". Arguments placed
in the parentheses will be passed to the function.

Note:
Functions in the "core" plugin can be accessed without specifying "core".
ex. "factor(7)" instead of "core.factor(7)"
